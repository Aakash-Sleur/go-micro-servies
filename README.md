## 📘 Project Overview

This repository contains a **practice microservice-style application** built using **Golang**, **Gin**, and **PostgreSQL**. The primary objective of this project is to explore and implement backend architecture principles using a layered, modular structure.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is intended for learning and experimentation. It is not production-ready, but it can serve as a useful reference for those exploring microservices and clean backend architecture in Go.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

* To understand and implement microservice-like architecture using Go.
* To explore layering patterns such as **repository → service → controller**.
* To experiment with RESTful API design and database integration with PostgreSQL.
* To practice building scalable and maintainable code in Go.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

The project follows a **modular layered structure**, organized for clarity, separation of concerns, and scalability. Here's a breakdown of the folders:

```
/project-root
│
├── cmd/             → Entry points for different services (if using multiple executables)
├── config/          → Application configuration and environment loading (e.g. DB setup)
├── controllers/     → HTTP request handlers (Gin controllers)
├── dto/             → Data Transfer Objects used between layers
├── middleware/      → Custom middleware for authentication, logging, etc.
├── models/          → Data models and database schema definitions
├── repository/      → Database access layer (CRUD logic)
├── routes/          → API route grouping and initialization
├── service/         → Business logic and service-level abstractions
├── utils/           → Utility functions (e.g., response formatting, error helpers)
│
├── .env             → Environment configuration file
├── go.mod           → Go module definition
├── go.sum           → Go dependencies checksum file
├── main.go          → Main entry point for starting the application
├── product-service.exe → Compiled executable (local build output)
```

### 🧭 Layer Flow

```
Routes → Controllers → Service → Repository → Models/DB
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

* Go (v1.18+ recommended)
* PostgreSQL running locally or via Docker
* Make (optional, for using the Makefile)

### ▶️ Run the Application

#### Method 1: Using `go run`

```bash
cd <service-folder>
go run main.go
```

#### Method 2: Using `make`

```bash
make <service-name>
```
